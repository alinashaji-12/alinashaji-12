## ABOUT ME

I am a B.Tech Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with focused academic training in Cyber Security.

My work centers on building applied AI systems — combining computer vision, natural language processing, and secure backend integration to create deployable, real-world solutions.

I am particularly interested in designing systems that move beyond experimentation and toward structured, production-ready implementation.

## ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

I approach Artificial Intelligence as a systems discipline — not just model training, but integration, scalability, and reliability.

The animation at the top represents continuous evolution — ideas initializing, systems stabilizing, intelligence refining.  

That flow reflects how I work:
Iteration → Optimization → Deployment → Improvement.

I am committed to building solutions that are technically sound, secure, and production-oriented.
