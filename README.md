## Who I Am

I am an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning student driven by one core idea:

Intelligence should be engineered — not just trained.

My work focuses on connecting models to systems — blending computer vision, NLP, and security principles to design reliable, production-aware AI applications.

---

## 🎯 Career Objective

To contribute to product-focused technology teams where AI is not experimental but embedded — building scalable, secure, and intelligent features that serve real users.

I am particularly interested in roles that involve:

- Applied Machine Learning
- Computer Vision engineering
- NLP systems integration
- AI system optimization
- Secure AI deployment

---

## 🔬 AI Research Interests

- Efficient model deployment for real-time systems  
- Reducing hallucination in Retrieval-Augmented architectures  
- Explainability in AI-driven decision systems  
- Human–AI interaction in conversational systems  
- Security-aware AI pipeline design  

I am curious about how intelligent systems behave under constraints — performance limits, security threats, and real-world unpredictability.

## 🛡 Cybersecurity Emphasis

My AI systems are built with defensive thinking.

Security is not an afterthought —  
it is integrated during design.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of:

AI × System Reliability × Secure Architecture

---

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

I care less about flashy demos and more about:

- Stability  
- Maintainability  
- Real-world behavior  
- Performance under constraint  

The animated header above reflects progression — iteration over time.

Each frame appears, fades, and transitions.

That mirrors how I build:

Idea → Prototype → Stress Test → Refine → Optimize → Deploy
