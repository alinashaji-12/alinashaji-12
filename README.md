# ALINA SHAJI  
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
Christ University (2023–2027)

## Profile

I design and implement intelligent systems with a focus on architectural clarity, reliability under constraints, and secure integration.

My work emphasizes end-to-end AI pipeline development — from data preprocessing and model selection to inference integration and deployment-aware backend structuring.

I am intentionally developing toward large-scale AI infrastructure engineering, where algorithmic rigor meets production stability.

---

## Current Focus

• Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines to reduce hallucination  
• Exploring latency-performance trade-offs in real-time computer vision systems  
• Strengthening algorithmic foundations (data structures, time/space complexity)  
• Improving model-to-backend communication reliability  

---

## Core Engineering Domains

### Systems-Oriented AI Engineering

- Designing structured ML pipelines with defined data flow boundaries  
- Implementing real-time inference loops with predictable latency  
- Integrating models into Flask-based backend services  
- Applying time complexity awareness during preprocessing and retrieval  

I prioritize deterministic behavior, scalability planning, and maintainability.

---

### Research-Driven Machine Learning

- TF-IDF and embedding-based semantic similarity exploration  
- Cosine similarity-based retrieval optimization  
- Vector search pipeline design for contextual grounding  
- Error analysis for generative output stabilization  

Ongoing exploration includes reducing hallucination through controlled retrieval mechanisms and improved context window strategies.

---

### Applied Product AI

- Real-time gesture recognition system using OpenCV  
- Feature extraction and threshold-based action mapping  
- NLP conversational system with preprocessing pipeline  
- Backend integration with structured request-response logic  

Implemented systems focus on measurable performance indicators such as response latency consistency, pipeline stability, and reduction of invalid outputs.

---

### Secure AI Systems Design

- Detection logic for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities  
- Payload pattern analysis and anomaly-based scoring  
- Risk classification mechanism design  
- Defensive backend integration strategies  

Security logic is incorporated during system design, not retrofitted after implementation.

## Engineering Philosophy

Scalable intelligence is engineered deliberately.

Design → Analyze → Benchmark → Refine → Secure → Deploy

The header animation reflects continuous iteration — structured advancement rather than abrupt change.

Durable systems are not accidental. They are engineered.
