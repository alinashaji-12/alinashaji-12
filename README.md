# ALINA SHAJI  
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
Christ University (2023–2027)

## Professional Profile

I build intelligent systems with structural clarity and long-term reliability in mind.

My focus is not just on training models — but on designing AI systems that are scalable, secure, and deployment-aware.

I approach engineering with discipline:

architecture before code,  
security before scale,  
stability before speed.

I am building toward becoming a systems-level AI engineer capable of contributing to high-impact product teams and research-driven environments.

---

## Career Objective

To work in product-focused and research-intensive environments where AI is integrated into real systems — not isolated experiments.

I aim to contribute to:

- Applied Machine Learning infrastructure  
- Real-time Computer Vision systems  
- NLP pipeline engineering  
- Secure AI deployment architectures  
- Performance-conscious model integration  

Long term, I intend to specialize in intelligent system design at scale — combining AI research depth with production reliability.

## Core Competency Areas

### 🔵 Systems-Oriented AI Engineering
- Structured ML pipeline development  
- Backend integration for AI applications  
- Real-time processing workflows  
- Model-to-system communication design  

I prioritize maintainability and clarity in system design.

---

### 🟣 Research-Driven Machine Learning
- Experimentation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
- Semantic search and embedding workflows  
- Dataset preparation and annotation strategies  
- Early exploration of explainability techniques  

My interest lies in improving model reliability under practical constraints.

---

### 🟢 Applied Product AI Development
- Hand Gesture-Based Application Launcher (Computer Vision)  
- NLP-Based Conversational Chatbot  
- LLM-powered Retrieval Systems  

I focus on transitioning ideas into functional, user-facing systems.

---

### 🛡 Secure AI Systems Perspective
- Web Vulnerability Detection (SQL Injection, XSS)  
- Risk scoring logic design  
- Behavior-based anomaly considerations  
- Defensive backend thinking  

AI systems must operate safely — not just intelligently.

## Engineering Philosophy

Strong systems evolve gradually.

They are designed, stress-tested, refined, and hardened.

The animated header represents iteration —  
each phase stabilizing before advancing.

That is how I build.
