## Professional Profile

I build AI systems with a systems-first mindset — prioritizing structure, reliability, and long-term scalability.

My work focuses on translating machine learning concepts into production-aware architectures where intelligence operates securely and efficiently within real constraints.

I am intentionally developing toward systems-level AI engineering — where research depth meets scalable infrastructure.

---

## Current Focus

- Improving reliability in Retrieval-Augmented architectures  
- Exploring efficiency trade-offs in real-time Computer Vision systems  
- Studying secure model integration within backend services  
- Strengthening data structure and algorithmic foundations  

---

## Career Direction

I am seeking opportunities within product-focused and high-performance engineering teams where:

- Machine learning models serve production systems  
- AI features are performance-measured  
- Reliability and security are engineering priorities  
- Technical depth and ownership are valued  

Long-term goal: to contribute to large-scale AI infrastructure and intelligent product systems.

## Engineering Philosophy

Scalable intelligence is engineered deliberately.

Design → Evaluate → Stress Test → Refine → Secure → Deploy.

The animated header reflects progression — controlled iteration rather than abrupt change.

That is how durable systems are built.
