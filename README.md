### Quietly building intelligent systems that scale.

</div>

---

<br>

## Overview

I build artificial intelligence systems with architectural clarity and long-term reliability in mind.

My focus is not on model experimentation alone —  
but on integrating machine learning into structured, secure, and scalable environments.

I am developing toward systems-level AI engineering where research depth meets production discipline.

## Core Areas of Work

### Computer Vision  
Real-time inference pipelines using OpenCV with structured feature mapping and latency-aware processing.

### Natural Language Processing  
Embedding-based semantic retrieval systems with cosine similarity optimization and contextual filtering.

### Secure Architecture  
SQL injection & XSS detection logic designed with defensive validation and risk-aware backend integration.

### Retrieval-Augmented Systems  
Vector-based similarity search pipelines to improve grounding and response stability in generative workflows.

## Engineering Philosophy

Precision over noise.  
Structure over complexity.  
Stability over hype.  

Elegant systems are not loud —  
they are deliberate.
