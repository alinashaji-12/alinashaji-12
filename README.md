# ALINA SHAJI  
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
Christ University (2023–2027)

## Who I Am

I engineer intelligence as a system — not just a model.

My approach connects:

Research depth  
System reliability  
Product usability  
Security thinking  

I focus on building AI solutions that are technically sound, performance-aware, and secure by design.

---

## Career Direction

I am seeking roles in product-based or research-driven environments where:

- Machine learning moves beyond experimentation  
- Models integrate into scalable systems  
- Security and performance are design priorities  
- AI features directly impact users  

Long-term vision:  
To work at the intersection of applied machine learning, AI system optimization, and secure deployment.

---

## Core Domains

### 🔵 Systems-Oriented AI Engineering
- Designing ML pipelines with structured flow  
- Real-time inference architecture  
- Backend integration using Flask  
- Data preprocessing and pipeline control  

I think in architecture before implementation.

---

### 🟣 Research-Driven ML Development
- Model experimentation and evaluation  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Dataset creation and annotation pipelines  
- Explainability and reduction of hallucination  

I am particularly interested in efficient deployment of ML models under constraints.

---

### 🟢 Product-Focused Applied AI
- Gesture-based real-time application launcher (Computer Vision)  
- NLP-driven chatbot system  
- Semantic retrieval frameworks  

My focus is building systems that users can actually use — not just notebooks that run.

---

### 🛡 Secure AI Systems Specialist
- Web vulnerability detection (SQL Injection, XSS)  
- Behavior-based analysis models  
- Risk scoring mechanisms  
- Backend security logic  

I approach AI from a defensive mindset — systems should remain reliable under adversarial conditions.

---

## Selected Work

### Hand Gesture-Based Application Launcher  
Real-time computer vision pipeline using OpenCV and backend integration for system-level control.

### Web Vulnerability Scanner  
Payload-based and behavior-based detection logic to identify web-layer security vulnerabilities.

### NLP Mini Chatbot  
Preprocessing, response logic, backend integration using Python and Flask.

### LLM-Powered RAG System  
Implemented document embedding, semantic search, and context-aware retrieval to improve output reliability.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

I build in phases:

Design → Prototype → Stress Test → Optimize → Secure → Deploy

The typing animation at the top reflects iteration.

Each phrase appears, stabilizes, and transitions —  
mirroring how engineered systems evolve.

Intelligence should not be fragile.

It should be dependable.
